There used to be a problem when creating an object named 'index_html'
in Plone using WebDAV.

The problem occurred because Plone Folder's 'index_html' was a
ComputedAttribute used to acquire index_html from skins when there was
no index_html Document on the portal root.

However, this ComputedAttribute didn't handle WebDAV 'PUT' request
correctly. This test ensures that the fix doesn't regress.

Give the Manager role to the current user:

  >>> from Testing.ZopeTestCase import user_name, user_password, folder_name
  >>> self.setRoles(['Manager'])

Create a Folder for testing:

  >>> self.portal.invokeFactory('Folder', 'test_folder_')
  >>> folder = self.portal._getOb('test_folder_')
  >>> folder_path = '/'.join(folder.getPhysicalPath())

Make sure index_html doesn't exist yet:

  >>> 'index_html' in folder.objectIds()
  False

PUT index_html into a Plone Folder. Should work just fine.

  >>> body = 'I am the walrus'
  >>> length = len(body)
  >>> print http(r"""
  ... PUT %s/index_html HTTP/1.1
  ... Content-Length: %d
  ... Authorization: Basic %s:%s
  ... <BLANKLINE>
  ... %s
  ... """ % (folder_path, length,
  ...        user_name, user_password, body),
  ...        handle_errors=False)
  HTTP/1.1 201 Created...

  >>> print folder._getOb('index_html').meta_type
  Document

Now, let's try the same at the Portal level.

  >>> folder_path = '/'.join(self.portal.getPhysicalPath())

Make sure index_html doesn't exist yet:

  >>> 'index_html' in self.portal.objectIds()
  False

But if you access it directly you should get a FSPageTemplate:

  >>> print self.portal.index_html.meta_type
  Filesystem Page Template

PUT index_html into Plone root. Should work just fine.

  >>> body = 'I am the walrus'
  >>> length = len(body)
  >>> print http(r"""
  ... PUT %s/index_html HTTP/1.1
  ... Content-Length: %d
  ... Authorization: Basic %s:%s
  ... <BLANKLINE>
  ... %s
  ... """ % (folder_path, length,
  ...        user_name, user_password, body),
  ...        handle_errors=False)
  HTTP/1.1 201 Created...

  >>> print self.portal._getOb('index_html').meta_type
  Document
