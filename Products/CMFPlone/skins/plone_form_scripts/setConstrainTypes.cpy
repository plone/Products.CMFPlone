# - types which are in "currentAllow" are to be removed from the
#   "immediatelyAddableTypes" list.
#
# That means:
# - users select types which they want to see in the menu using the
#   "immediatelyAddableTypes" list
# - if the user wants to see a certain type _only_ in the "more ..."
#   form, then they select it inside the "locallyAllowedTypes" list.
