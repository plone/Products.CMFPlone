    <h2>Make it your own</h2>

    <p>Plone has many settings to make it do what you want. Some examples include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
    Try out a different theme, either pick from
        <a href="@@theming-controlpanel"
           target="_blank"
        >the included ones</a>, or one of the
        <a class="link-plain"
           href="https://plone.org/download/add-ons"
           target="_blank"
        >available themes
          from plone.org</a>.
        <span class="discreet">Make sure the theme is
          compatible with the version of Plone you are currently using.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="@@content-controlpanel"
           target="_blank"
        >
          Decide what kind of workflow you want in your site.</a>
        <span class="discreet">The default is typical for a
    public web site; if you want to use Plone as a closed intranet or extranet,
          you can choose a different workflow.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
    By default, Plone uses a visual editor for content.
        <span class="discreet">If you prefer text-based syntax and/or wiki
        syntax, you can change this in the
          <a href="@@markup-controlpanel"
             target="_blank"
          >markup control panel</a></span>
      </li>

      <li>&hellip;and many more settings are available in the
        <a href="@@overview-controlpanel"
           target="_blank"
        >Site Setup</a>.
