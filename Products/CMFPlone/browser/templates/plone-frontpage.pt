<h2>Get started</h2>

<p>
Before you start exploring your newly created Plone site, please do the following:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Make sure you are logged in as an admin/manager user.
        <span class="discreet">You should have a Site Setup entry in the user menu.</span></li>
    <li><a href="@@mail-controlpanel" target="_blank">Set up your mail server</a>. <span class="discreet">Plone needs a valid SMTP server to verify users and send out password reminders.</span></li>
    <li><a href="@@security-controlpanel" target="_blank">Decide what security level you want on your site</a>. <span class="discreet">Allow self registration, password policies, and more.</span></li>
</ol>

<h2>Get comfortable</h2>

<p>After that, we suggest you do one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Get the latest <a class="link-plain" href="https://plone.org/news" target="_blank">news</a> about Plone.</li>
    <li>Read the <a class="link-plain" href="https://6.docs.plone.org" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</li>

<h2>Make it your own</h2>

<p>Plone has many settings to make it do what you want. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    Try out a different theme, either pick from
    <a href="@@theming-controlpanel" target="_blank">the included ones</a>, or one of the
    <a class="link-plain"
       href="https://plone.org/download/add-ons" target="_blank">available themes
       from plone.org</a>. <span class="discreet">Make sure the theme is
       compatible with the version of Plone you are currently using.</span>
    </li>

    <li>
    <a href="@@content-controlpanel" target="_blank">
    Decide what kind of workflow you want in your site.</a>
    <span class="discreet">The default is typical for a
    public web site; if you want to use Plone as a closed intranet or extranet,
    you can choose a different workflow.</span>
    </li>

    <li>
    By default, Plone uses a visual editor for content.
    <span class="discreet">If you prefer text-based syntax and/or wiki
        syntax, you can change this in the
    <a href="@@markup-controlpanel" target="_blank">markup control panel</a></span>
    </li>

    <li>…and many more settings are available in the
        <a href="@@overview-controlpanel" target="_blank">Site Setup</a>.
