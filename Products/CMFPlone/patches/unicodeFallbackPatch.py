# The following hacks make sure that Unicode and utf-8 encoded strings can be
# mixed in all page templates and tal snippets.

# While the general direction is to require Unicode in all places, we need to
# provide a gentle evolution path, as we cannot radically change this
# requirement and end up with lots of broken code. Our strategy is to allow
# only utf-8 encoded strings though in order to limit the performance impact
# instead of supporting all encodings.

# Therefor these patches will probably stay here for quite a while.
