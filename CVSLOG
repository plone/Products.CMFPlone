	  plone_scripts/date_components_support.py (Plone-2_0-branch): Bob
	  commands you to scream 'Python 2.3' - NOW! this was such a PITA
	  because of DateTime's crappy API.  This still does not work -
	  100% Bernard needs to look at it.

	    - The calendar_slot is *much* cleaner

	    - We can get rid of the extract_date_components.py (let bernard
	  do that)

	    - Added a much more flexible date_componenets_support.py file
	  which is
	    a good example of 'best practices' (dont mind the DateTime
	  mess) of working
	    with ZPT from Python Script.

	  and reusable, but note that if your site relied a lot on the old
	  stylesheet_properties file, you will have to move the attributes
	  to the new file. The reason for renaming it was to not cause
	  errors when upgrading. It will reset your color choices, though.
	  The new properties are documented in ploneCustom.css. Also
	  brought back the old CSS for the pull-down menu, still not
	  perfect, but good enough for the beta.

	  position can be one out of top,up,down,bottom untested and

	  folder_contents has two new links for each item according to the
	  new for the new buttons an icon is missing, i recycled the
	  existing one.  feel free to design a better solution.

	  to use ordered folders within archtypes some work has to be done.

	  'hidden' entrys, like tools, catalogs, ... are in the sorting
	  prozess too.	so sometimes a move doesnt seems to move something
	  but it do!

	  why we have CVS right?

	  From what I can see in no way should the page returned be based
	  upon the users request. Further if a user does a POST this will
	  return the page "POST", which is meaningless. If for some god
	  knows why reason request isnt present this will return context
	  which is an unpack error.

	  Those things combined is why Im removing this patch, we should
	  write a unit test and make sure these changes were made for the
	  right reason.

	  workflow cruft was being injected into the personalBar.  this

	  getOrderedUserActions places the actions in a sane order
	  (configurable through parameters)

	  keyFilteredActions given filterdActionsFor dictioanry will create
	  a two dimensional dictionary [category][action_id] this is *very*
	  handy.  the two dimensonal dictionary is also being called in

	  would be nice *wink*

	* skins/: plone_scripts/plonifyContentActions.py,

	  the final missing piece of the content bar to support
	  object_actions - still requires some CSS tweaking, but that will
	  be done during the beta period - I'm way too tired now. :)

	  Alan, if you're reading this, please take a look at the
	  plonifyContentActions script - it was shamelessly ripped from
	  plonifyActions, probably it doesn't require all that cruft. Its
	  only mission is to get the object_actions from a particular
	  content type - maybe I don't need a PyScript at all.

	  I'm ready for the beta, finally :)

	  OK - looks like I lied when I said it was the last change to the
	  main templates - one more has to go in. ;) The rendering of
	  content views (tabs) and content actions is much more flexible
	  now. And semantically much much better. :) Please be aware of the
	  changes if you have customized plone.css, main_template or
	  view_tabs.

	  contentbar_status_modify just copy/pasted content_status_modify's
	  code! why?! just call it! and then redirect afterwards.  Whoever
	  implemented this (bernard/pascal) owes me a beir.

	  content_status_modify now tries to call plone_utils.contentEdit()
	  before the transition and if it fails will attempt to call it
	  again.

	  For instance:

	    Something is published: I want to change the expiry date and
	  retract it.

	    The first call to contentEdit fails because it has not been
	  transitioned
	    into a state that I can modify.  So we fail.  We then
	  tranistion the
	    object to the new state.  Then we attempt to call contentEdit
	  *again*
	    since it is now in a state where we are allowed to change it.

2003-09-19 18:48  k_vertigo

	* ChangeLog:  - update autogen'd changelog

2003-09-19 15:50  roeder

	* skins/plone_scripts/navigationLocalRelated.py: Fixing collector
	  issue 1067. The existing Implementation not only excluded links
	  to itself, but also to documents with ids that are a prefix of
	  the original documents' id.

2003-09-19 14:35  shh42

	* tests/: testFolderLocalRoleForm.py, testMemberDataTool.py: * Mark
	  unfinished tests with string 'TODO'

2003-09-19 12:58  shh42

	* MembershipTool.py: * Removed the commit. Explicit commits are
	  bad.

2003-09-19 12:40  shh42

	* tests/testContentTypeScripts.py: * Test the edit scripts of
	  (nearly) all content types

2003-09-19 12:37  shh42

	* tests/testFolderLocalRoleForm.py: * Fix some tests for runyaga

2003-09-19 12:36  shh42

	* tests/testMembershipTool.py: * Fix some tests for robert

2003-09-19 12:36  shh42

	* tests/testActionsTool.py: * Test if addAction works

2003-09-19 12:35  shh42

	* tests/: testSkeletonPloneTest.py, testSkeletonZopeTest.py: * Add
	  a comment as to why test_suite is required

2003-09-19 12:34  shh42

	* tests/testPortalCreation.py: * Add test for Plone skin setup

2003-09-19 09:56  redcor

	* tests/testMembershipTool.py: remove a print that i forgot to
	  remove

2003-09-19 07:45  redcor

	* MembershipTool.py, skins/plone_form_scripts/personalize.py,
	  skins/plone_forms/personalize_form.pt,
	  skins/plone_prefs/prefs_user_details.pt,
	  skins/plone_templates/registered_notify_template.pt,
	  tests/testMembershipTool.py: changed personalise_form to use the
	  portrait from membershiptool. fixed changeMemberPortrait when not
	  getting an id. commented out obsolete unittest. added new one
	  that does not yet anything

2003-09-19 02:57  runyaga

	* skins/plone_form_scripts/folder_localrole_edit.py,
	  tests/testFolderLocalRoleForm.py: cleaned up
	  folder_localrole_edit added a test that I believe demonstrates
	  that GRUF is possibly not doing the right thing when called?
	  Stefan is this correct? can I commit() like this? in the
	  framework? will it begin() a new trnx?  I need to read the docs!
	  ;-)

	  I will get PJ to look at this.  But it seems that when GRUF gets
	  the object to inspect for context it ends up getting a
	  RequestContainer not a 'Plone Folder'

2003-09-19 01:55  limi

	* skins/plone_portlets/: events_slot.pt, news_slot.pt,
	  recently_published_slot.pt, workflow_review_slot.pt: All portlets
	  now show the description of the item when you hover over it

2003-09-19 01:53  zworkb

	* StatelessTree.py: the last checkin brought an indentation error
	  that caused published content not to be displayed for anon users.

2003-09-19 01:53  runyaga

	* Portal.py: by default run the 'Default Plone' custom policy.
	  Very ugly that this was set in HTML via hidden form element.	It
	  should not be there and just be the default for the args in
	  manage_addSite.

2003-09-19 01:46  limi

	* skins/plone_styles/: plone.css.dtml, stylesheet_properties.props:
	  Logo flickering in IE should be fixed. Thanks to eaon for this :)

2003-09-19 01:31  runyaga

	* HISTORY.txt, Portal.py, migrations/plone1_1.py: QuickInstaller is
	  now installed in PortalGenerator.setupTools() We also notify
	  QInstaller that CMFActionIcons and CMFCalendar are both installed
	  (this was a huge usabiltiy problems for noobs)

2003-09-19 00:44  runyaga

	* skins/plone_forms/content_status_history.pt: on publishing form
	  made the 'default' (nonaction) transition called 'No change' this
	  will need to be fixed by the i18n groups

2003-09-19 00:15  runyaga

	* PloneTool.py: check permissions on the object in contentEdit.
	  contentEdit is Publicly accesible but the object is checked for
	  ModifyPortalContent permissions.  This is not necessarily VALID!
	  But there is no other way of doing this because you do not know
	  what the "edit" method permission of the object is.  This is a
	  Zope/CMF design flaw.

2003-09-18 23:52  runyaga

	* PloneTool.py, skins/plone_scripts/folder_publish.py: protected
	  contentEdit/metadataEdit methods on plone_utils and
	  folder_publish will apply effective/expiry dates if defined in
	  the content status form

2003-09-18 23:15  runyaga

	* skins/plone_templates/folder_contents.pt:
	  here/folder_contents/macros/folder_listing is used in
	  content_status_modify (reuse is good) but the isOrdered and the
	  interface assertions were defined above the folder_listing macro
	  ;-( moved them into the macro

2003-09-18 20:40  shh42

	* tests/PloneTestCase.py: * Speed up portal creation by roughly
	  40%. Way cool.

	* MemberDataTool.py: Fixing two except: pass. Seems to work, hasnt
	  broken anything here yet.

	  Do not do except: pass!!!!

	* migrations/: plone1_1.py, upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py: removed extedit
	  icon from plone control panel and some other ui elements that are
	  uneditable via extedit.

2003-09-18 16:22  tizziano

	  mailhost.

2003-09-17 14:33  shh42

	* tests/testInterfaceTool.py: * Use ZopeTestCase instead of bare
	  TestCase to avoid unnecessary confusion.

2003-09-17 14:22  shh42

	* HISTORY.txt, MembershipTool.py, tests/testMembershipTool.py: *
	  Optimized listMembers by using GRUF API * Removed a bare except:
	  statement in listMemberIds.

	  POTENTIALLY
	    CORRUPTING YOUR ZODB IN THE PROCESS!

	* tests/testMembershipTool.py: added test to check listMemberIds

2003-09-16 21:33  shh42

	* setup/ConfigurationMethods.py, tests/PloneTestCase.py: *
	  ExternalEditor product was not really optional.

	  * Reverted the previous change to PloneTestCase as the real fix
	  (tm) was   somewhere else (see above).

2003-09-16 20:45  ueck

	* workflows/: CommunityWorkflow.png, IntranetWorkflow.png,
	  OneStepPublicationWorkflow.png, workflow_models.odm: added
	  ObjectDomain R3 Model and Diagrams to the directory for
	  documentation

2003-09-16 19:32  ueck

	* workflows/: CommunityWorkflow.py, OneStepPublicationWorkflow.py,
	  __init__.py: checkin in the work that was done at the
	  castle-sprint.  the OneStepPublicationWorkflow is tested and
	  should work as default workflow for a plone1.1 site the
	  CommunityWorkflow is still work-in-progress .. (intra/extranet
	  aren't yet really started, cause they are based on the
	  community-workflow

	  this checkin doesn't change anything within plone .. it's just to
	  have our work checked in and available.

2003-09-15 16:08  limi

	* HISTORY.txt, skins/plone_forms/password_form.pt: - Removed
	  Domains from the user preferences - this field makes it very easy
	  to lock yourself out of your account, and should therefore only
	  be available to administrators.

2003-09-03 19:15  zopezen

	* skins/plone_scripts/showEditableBorder.py: minor improvement,
	  only do one check for workflow, instead of 2 and only do one
	  iteration of actions instead of 4

2003-09-03 01:41  zworkb

	* skins/plone_ecmascript/plone_javascript_variables.js.dtml:
	  strings need quotes, even in javascript :)

2003-09-02 20:45  philikon

	* skins/plone_forms/: plone_control_panel.pt,
	  prefs_user_details.pt, prefs_users_overview.pt: Give the control

2003-08-20 13:05  tesdal

	* skins/plone_templates/sendto_template.pt: Added a space after the
	  signature separator, now it's "-- " instead of "--"

2003-08-18 17:16  jb7

	* skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml: set border: none to
	  .hiddenstructure (it inherited it e.g. when used together with
	  h5)

2003-08-18 15:46  jb7

	* skins/plone_ecmascript/plone_javascripts.js.dtml: corrected
	  javascript error: the id of the document is documentContent, not
	  bodyContent

2003-08-18 05:22  eaon

	* skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml:
	  made stylesheet ie 5.5 compatible, made some tab spaces "plonish"

2003-08-18 03:19  ronnix

	* skins/plone_styles/plonePrint.css.dtml: Catch up with recent
	  changes.

2003-08-17 21:20  philikon

	* __init__.py: runyaga must have forgotten to check in the
	  SyndicationTool module.

2003-08-17 20:37  runyaga

	* ActionsTool.py, HISTORY.txt, MetadataTool.py, Portal.py,
	  TypesTool.py, UndoTool.py, __init__.py: now a SiteErrorLog is
	  created in a newly constructed Plone.  Also starting to add
	  Subclasses of core CMF tools so if we need to extend them it will
	  be easier

2003-08-17 20:12  ronnix

	* skins/plone_forms/password_form.pt: Fixed i18n msgid.

2003-08-17 20:02  runyaga

	* URLTool.py, __init__.py: adding URLTool for Plone.  We should
	  subclass *all* default tools that come with CMF.  The biggest
	  problem we have is migrating people upwards.	So for 1.1 it might
	  make sense to subclass all default tools and instead of creating
	  the defaults using our subclasses.  this gives us a extension
	  point into the all the tools.

	  this will help quite a bit when we start moving to use the
	  eventservice

2003-08-17 19:59  runyaga

	* HISTORY.txt: removal of portal_form_validation

2003-08-17 19:58  runyaga

	* Portal.py: removed portal_form_validation from being constructed.
	  did not remove the .py file.  will do that in 1.2

2003-08-17 19:21  runyaga

	* migrations/plone1_1.py: issue 1415 fixed the
	  creation,migration,customization ugliness partly to blame

2003-08-17 18:55  runyaga

	* PloneTool.py, skins/plone_content/metadata_edit_form.pt: fixed to
	  make discussion work and minor cleanups

2003-08-17 17:59  ronnix

	* skins/plone_forms/: prefs_group_details.pt,
	  prefs_group_members.pt, prefs_groups_overview.pt,
	  prefs_user_details.pt, prefs_user_memberships.pt,
	  prefs_users_overview.pt: Updated fake tabs to the new style.

2003-08-17 05:38  runyaga

	* PloneTool.py, skins/plone_content/metadata_edit_form.pt: someone
	  broke metadata form at some point.  cleaned up PloneTool.

	  NOTE: CMFDefault PortalContent no declares the Discussionable
	  xface which makes discussions no longer work with Plone on
	  metadata form.

2003-08-16 22:28  plonista

	* PloneControlPanel.py: Added a title

2003-08-16 22:27  plonista

	* FactoryTool.py: Fixed ZMI for FactoryTool

2003-08-16 22:27  plonista

	* www/portal_factory_manage_overview.zpt: Initial check-in

2003-08-16 22:21  runyaga

	* skins/plone_scripts/createObject.py: CMFFormController has odd
	  interactions with traversal/absolute_url now we can work with the
	  new PloneWorkspaces component

2003-08-16 20:10  runyaga

	* HISTORY.txt, MembershipTool.py, Extensions/Upgrade.py: password
	  changing now works again against all modern UserFolders that
	  support the UserFolder xface

2003-08-15 19:35  philikon

	* skins/plone_templates/news.pt: Removed obsolete "import".

2003-08-14 12:55  arnia

	* skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml: Woohoo! Its fixed

2003-08-14 12:51  ronnix

	* skins/plone_scripts/browserDefault.py: Force copy to prevent
	  modifying site properties.

2003-08-14 12:21  tesdal

	* PloneControlPanel.py: Some more fixes.  Remove entry from
	  actionicons when removing configlets and applications.  Fixed the
	  selection argument for removeApplication aswell, same as the fix
	  for removeConfiglet yesterday.

2003-08-14 06:06  limi

	* skins/plone_images/plone_powered.gif: logo change, still in draft
	  stage

2003-08-14 02:29  ronnix

	* skins/plone_templates/viewThreadsAtBottom.pt: Fixed possible
	  AttributeError.  test() is not a short circuit operator :-/

2003-08-13 13:51  tesdal

	* PloneControlPanel.py: Fixed a bug on unregistering configlets.
	  When deleting actions you pass the indexes to delete, not the
	  actions or action ids to delete.

2003-08-13 02:30  limi

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	  plone_templates/global_elements.pt: Some fixes to the new
	  ul-based personalBar - thanks to Arnia for the initial work, and
	  eaon for fixing some CSS bugs.

2003-08-13 01:10  zopezen

	* setup/dependencies.py: Neither of these are errors, just
	  information. Set severity as such, they will now show up as per
	  the users settings in zope 2.7

2003-08-12 22:58  runyaga

	* skins/plone_forms/history_form.pt: move the tal:define into table
	  out of form define's happen before conditions.  also made
	  aesthetic changes

2003-08-12 16:11  ronnix

	* skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml: CSS fixes for personal bar.

2003-08-12 01:41  arnia

	* skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml: Fix for 1px Rounding bugs in
	  tabs

2003-08-12 01:33  arnia

	* skins/plone_templates/global_elements.pt: Removed ids from
	  personal bar list to solve workflow incompatabilities

2003-08-12 01:16  arnia

	* skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml: YATU - Yet another tidy up

2003-08-12 01:04  arnia

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml, plone_templates/footer.pt:
	  Stopped tab links being styled with an underline

2003-08-12 00:52  arnia

	* skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml: Stylesheet fixes

2003-08-12 00:13  arnia

	* skins/plone_templates/: global_elements.pt, view_tabs.pt: Removed
	  firstItem and lastItem until I can figure out how to implement
	  them properly. Sorry for the breakage.

2003-08-11 18:43  limi

	* setup/ConfigurationMethods.py: Changed ordering of the boxes
	  slightly.

2003-08-11 11:35  arnia

	* skins/plone_templates/global_elements.pt: Added firstItem and
	  lastItem classes to the personalBar list. Yay for endcaps

2003-08-11 11:08  arnia

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	  plone_templates/main_template.pt: Made .document and
	  .editableDocument mutually exclusive

2003-08-11 10:53  arnia

	* skins/plone_templates/: global_elements.pt, main_template.pt,
	  view_tabs.pt: Classes for unique chrome now completely removed.
	  We don't need them if people will have to rewrite their CSS files
	  anyway, and this will remove temptation to use the classes.

2003-08-11 10:42  arnia

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	  plone_templates/global_elements.pt: Personal bar now uses
	  unordered list. Images in personal bar now in CSS. Hidden (yet
	  screenreader accessible) structural labels to cope with list
	  overload (thanks to Eaon for idea)

2003-08-11 10:18  zworkb

	* skins/plone_scripts/prepare_slots.py: #check if the *_slots
	  attributes are callable so that they can be overridden #by
	  methods or python scripts

2003-08-11 09:20  arnia

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	  plone_templates/global_elements.pt, plone_templates/view_tabs.pt:
	  Content actions are now in an unordered list. .selected class
	  moved to list item for greater flexibility. Stylesheets tidied up
	  again to match templates.

2003-08-11 08:54  arnia

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	  plone_templates/global_elements.pt,
	  plone_templates/site_actions.pt: Added firstItem and lastItem
	  classes to first and last list items in autogenerated lists to
	  workaround IE's lack of support for CSS2 selectors. Moved
	  stylesheets over to using ids rather than classes (faster
	  rendering) and tidied up the portaltabs selectors to allow
	  removal of portaltab class from template (redundant information)

2003-08-11 08:23  arnia

	* skins/plone_templates/: global_elements.pt, main_template.pt:
	  Added ids in parallel to classes on unique chrome elements to
	  deprecate classes on these elements. Classes are much slower to
	  render than ids so avoid if possible!

2003-08-10 13:27  arnia

	* skins/plone_styles/plonePresentation.css.dtml: Hiding the skipnav
	  in the presentation stylesheet

2003-08-10 13:16  arnia

	* skins/plone_styles/: plone.css.dtml, stylesheet_properties.props:
	  More spacing fixes for the header - credits to Eaon

2003-08-10 12:35  arnia

	* skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml: Fixing a spacing problem as a
	  result of moving the location of the logo class

2003-08-10 00:41  arnia

	* skins/plone_templates/global_elements.pt: Fixed the label in the
	  search widget so pages validate as XHTML1.0 Transitional and
	  moved the logo class to the anchor for more flexible skinning.

2003-08-08 15:45  limi

	* skins/plone_templates/ui_slots/news_slot.pt: Added "More" link to
	  the News box.

2003-08-08 15:44  limi

	* setup/ConfigurationMethods.py,
	  skins/plone_forms/login_success.pt,
	  skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	  skins/plone_templates/recently_published.pt,
	  skins/plone_templates/ui_slots/recently_published_slot.pt: Added
	  a new slot for items published since your last login, activated
	  it on new site creation (don't put this in migrations, as it
	  shouldn't suddenly pop up on an existing site).

	  It also has a link to a page listing all the published items in
	  reversely chronological order.

	  Added a new a.more class for the "More..." links to be used in
	  slots.

	* HISTORY.txt, MembershipTool.py,
	  skins/plone_forms/password_form.pt,
	  skins/plone_scripts/form_scripts/change_password.py,
	  skins/plone_scripts/form_scripts/plone_change_password.py:
	  changing passwords now requires a user to know their 'current'
	  password.  also change the scripts name to
	  'plone_change_password' instead of 'change_password' to reduce
	  likelihood of namespace collision.  gruf still must change their
	  script id as well.

2003-08-06 01:09  runyaga

	* migrations/: __init__.py, one03_one04.py (Plone-1_0): added noop
	  migration from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4

2003-08-05 15:38  zworkb

	* migrations/__init__.py: removed references to purged migrations

2003-08-05 10:36  runyaga

	  migrations/beta1_beta2.py, migrations/plone1_1.py,
	  setup/ConfigurationMethods.py,
	  skins/plone_templates/folder_contents.pt,
	  skins/plone_templates/main_template.pt: removed ancient
	  migrations folded all plone1.1 relevant construction methods into
	  the plone1_1 module called by PloneGenerator which now
	  setsInstance(1.1) and calls make_plone

	  status tabs are now resposibility of individual portal_types
	  instead of global definition on portal_actions

	  made images for the contents in a folder absolute with portal_url

2003-08-05 08:42  runyaga

	* skins/plone_templates/folder_contents.pt: image urls in
	  folder_contents are anchored with portal instead of content/$icon

2003-08-05 07:47  runyaga

	* skins/plone_templates/folder_contents.pt (Plone-1_0): generate
	  icon URL in folder entries that are anchored by portal instead of
	  the context.. these URL's are more cache friendly

2003-08-05 04:14  limi

	* HISTORY.txt (Plone-1_0): History updated with WAI-A/508 details

2003-08-05 02:35  runyaga

2003-08-04 18:48  ronnix

	* FactoryTool.py: Fixed location of newly created objects.

2003-08-04 00:08  ronnix

	* PloneFolder.py: Folder default views should work as advertised
	  now...

2003-08-04 00:05  ronnix

	* PloneFolder.py: Oops. Forgot to make 'folderlisting' type action
	  invisible...

2003-08-03 23:39  ronnix

	* skins/plone_scripts/browserDefault.py: Hopefully fixing remaining
	  issues with default folder views.

2003-08-03 23:29  ronnix

	  folder views.

2003-08-03 23:25  ronnix

	  issues with default folder views.

2003-08-03 22:42  ronnix

	* skins/plone_scripts/breadcrumbs.py: Remove trailing 'view' from
	  links to folders.  This gives us identical links in the
	  breadcrumbs and in the nav box, hopefully reducing user
	  confusion...

2003-07-31 04:15  plonista

	* HISTORY.txt: Updated HISTORY

2003-07-31 04:11  plonista

	* ChangeLog: Updated the ChangeLog

2003-07-31 03:35  plonista

	* FactoryTool.py, FormTool.py: Big rewrite of FactoryTool so that
	  permissions of the temporary object are created properly.  The
	  fixed version is a bit more efficient than the old version, but
	  it requires some minor changes to FormTool.

2003-07-31 03:05  jccooper

	* skins/plone_forms/: prefs_group_details.pt,
	  prefs_group_members.pt: fix for invalid of missing name

2003-07-30 09:46  zworkb

	* skins/plone_scripts/browserDefault.py: philikon: your last change
	  broke plone, because PloneFolder has no action called
	  'folderlisting' I never had this recursion problem, but in order
	  to avoid the recursion I return 'folder_listing' as string, since
	  the action does not exist.

2003-07-30 03:19  zworkb

	* StatelessTree.py, StatelessTreeNav.py: added property
	  'idsNotToList' that suppresses certain ids to be displayed in the
	  navtree

2003-07-29 23:38  limi

	* skins/plone_images/rss.gif: Forgot to check in the RSS icon :)

2003-07-29 16:19  philikon

	  problem with logged_in with Python 2.3

2003-07-29 06:59  limi

	* HISTORY.txt: Added the night's changes.

2003-07-29 06:25  sh1mmer

	  Arnia for the css)

2003-07-29 06:04  limi

	  externaleditor.

2003-07-29 06:03  limi

	  here anymore.

2003-07-29 05:27  dreamcatcher

	* ChangeLog, skins/plone_scripts/browserDefault.py: BrowserDefault
	  lookup on Context

2003-07-29 04:30  limi

	* migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py,
	  skins/plone_images/extedit_icon.gif: - Added support for
	  FrontPage as default page in a folder (for ZWiki) - Added
	  External Editor icon and functionality to the documentActions.
	  Somebody else will have to look at the permissions and the
	  checking of the site properties, I couldn't get them to work.

2003-07-28 01:43  limi

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	  plone_templates/global_elements.pt,
	  plone_templates/main_template.pt: Added the super secret (well,
	  maybe not anymore ;) roles-based task switcher stuff to the
	  template. No code for it yet, but I want to avoid changing
	  main_template later.

2003-07-28 00:58  philikon

	* skins/plone_scripts/browserDefault.py: Do not return the 'view'
	  action on an empty folder because that will invoke this script
	  again, thus sending the ZPublisher to recursion hell.

2003-07-27 14:59  limi

	* PloneControlPanel.py: Added user icon

2003-07-27 14:56  limi

	  code if you are developing CustomizationPolicies.

	  skins/plone_templates/ui_slots/actions_slot.pt: Replaced the XML
	  button with an RSS one, added proper RSS and XML icons, changed
	  templates and migration to reflect this.

2003-07-26 09:54  limi

	* MigrationTool.py: Changed the end-of-migration message to sound
	  less like something went wrong.

	  Earlier it said: "No upgrade path found from that version,
	  migration stopping"

	  Now it says: "Your ZODB and Filesystem Plone instances are
	  up-to-date."

	  Thanks to David Coe and Kirk Lowery for pointing this out.

2003-07-26 06:44  limi

	* HISTORY.txt: Added Geoff's portal_factory notes

2003-07-26 00:19  limi

	* setup/dependencies.py: The wording sounded like ExternalEditor
	  was absolutely necessary to get Plone running. Changed it to
	  sound like it's optional (which it is)

2003-07-25 04:23  limi

	* skins/plone_templates/view_tabs.pt: Fixed it so that the content
	  bar doesn't collapse if the item is not workflowable.

2003-07-25 01:10  limi

	* www/migrationRun.dtml: Made it painfully clear that backup is a
	  good idea before migrating.

2003-07-24 12:45  vladoi

	  i18n:translate

2003-07-24 01:32  zworkb

	  bottomLevel, works correctly if the property isnt defined at all

2003-07-24 01:13  zworkb

	* PloneTool.py, StatelessTree.py, StatelessTreeNav.py: added new
	  parameter to treenav: bottomLevel: it detemines themaximum level
	  to which the navtree expandes

2003-07-23 22:32  runyaga

	* MembershipTool.py (Plone-1_0): MembershipTool.py wasnt using
	  homePageText script ;-)

2003-07-23 00:58  limi

	* HISTORY.txt: Removed the CMFWeblog templates and added them in
	  the product itself instead. (In Collective CVS)

2003-07-23 00:02  limi

	* PloneInitialize.py: where did out = [] go?

2003-07-22 17:10  plonista

	* skins/plone_forms/login_form.pt: Modified cookie testing code in
	  logins to fix problems with IE 5.0.

	  skins/plone_scripts/breadcrumbs.py,
	  skins/plone_scripts/createObject.py: * Factory tool from
	  CMFMember is now wired in.  To use the factory tool when creating
	  an object, enter the object's class name in
	  site_properties.portal_factory_types.

	  * I discovered some brokenness in StatelessTreeNav.py.  There's a
	  comment that describes it fully plus a kludgey workaround.

	  * There is a new registration tool that does better password
	  generation.  Passwords can't have 1, I, l, 0, or O -- that way
	  it's harder for people to misread their passwords.

2003-07-19 22:47  sh1mmer

	* skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml (Plone-1_0): Added skipnav
	  class

2003-07-19 22:44  sh1mmer

	  tag" bug.

2003-07-16 08:54  zopezen

	* skins/plone_content/metadata_edit_form.pt: (23:49:09) Alan
	  Runyan: isDisussable is old (23:49:11) Alan Runyan: we should use
	  (23:49:21) Alan Runyan:
	  here.portal_discussions.isDiscussionAllowedFor()

2003-07-16 08:45  zopezen

	* migrations/beta2_beta3.py: Fix ConfigurationMethods path

2003-07-16 08:07  zopezen

	* dependencies.py: Remove dependencies.py

2003-07-16 08:07  zopezen

	* Configuration.py, ConfigurationMethods.py,
	  CustomizationPolicy.py, MigrationTool.py, Portal.py,
	  setup/ConfigurationMethods.py, setup/__init__.py,
	  setup/dependencies.py, www/addSite.zpt: Hold onto your butts!

	  Get rid of ConfigurationMethods for 1.3 and move the rest into

	* migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py: Oops :)

2003-07-16 07:04  zopezen

	* migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py: Change the plone_help thing to
	  look in help rather than docs, because nothing in docs is
	  suitable to show to anybody and we can have two levels of docs,
	  docs for installers / developers, help for end users

2003-07-16 07:02  zopezen

	* MigrationTool.py, Portal.py: Stop the migration tool swallowing
	  all errors, remove runyaga's change, not sure why thats needed

2003-07-16 06:56  zopezen

	* migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py: Move the commit() up a notch to
	  the top of the script, its terrible to have this in a migration
	  script, but this way if it fails it can be re-run without
	  anything blowing up

2003-07-16 05:38  zopezen

	* dependencies.py: Maybe telling people that GroupUserFolder is
	  required would be an idea...

2003-07-15 05:34  runyaga

	* MigrationTool.py, migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py:  - moved stmt's
	  into several functions and general upg_1x reformatting.
	   - MigrationTool when it borks now logs stuff in error_log
	   - You MUST use QuickInstaller in CVS (as it was severely borken)
	  and now
	     we depend on the Exception, AlreadyInstalled

	  Mozilla (first paragraph was shown as a link).

2003-07-12 18:45  zopezen

	* Portal.py: Actually make a portal_actionicons tool, what a
	  concept

2003-07-12 18:37  zopezen

	* dependencies.py: Make the severity high enough so the error
	  actually goes to the log file :)

2003-07-11 10:21  sh1mmer

	* skins/plone_templates/footer.pt: Changed the upgrade link to the
	  new url that WaSP ask you to use.

	* skins/plone_forms/mail_password_template.dtml: added
	  mail_password_template.dtml from CMFDefault (its not anymore in
	  the path)

2003-07-02 03:31  zworkb

	* skins/plone_templates/ui_slots/navigation_tree_slot.pt: the root
	  of the tree is now called 'Home' (greetings to sch1mmer :)

2003-07-02 02:33  zworkb

	* skins/plone_templates/homePageText.pt: added the nocall because
	  it broke CMFMember (the Member class has a __call__ method)

2003-07-01 22:52  zworkb

	* PropertiesTool.py: reconfigure_portal action now points to
	  plone_control_panel

2003-06-30 03:54  sh1mmer

2003-06-30 02:58  sh1mmer

	* migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py: Commented out GRUF migration
	  because it was breaking stuff. Alan or someone can fix it later
	  but I thought it was more important to have a work migration
	  because right now all plone .1.1 including 1.1a1 installations
	  cant add new sites (the migration breaks at 1.0.3).

2003-06-30 00:19  ronnix

	* dependencies.py, docs/REQUIREMENTS.txt: Updated list of required

	* skins/: plone_forms/prefs_groups_overview.pt,
	  plone_scripts/form_scripts/prefs_group_add.py,
	  plone_scripts/form_scripts/prefs_group_edit.py: ability to add

	  portlets_fetcher template, and obviously doesn't work. It should
	  probably be in main_template, try to make it as minimal as
	  possible - as main_template shouldn't really have code, only
	  structure :)

	  - Improved fix for IE6 disappearing text bug - it should not be
	  technically possible to get this anymore ;)

	  - Removed excessive divs in code, converted some classes to IDs.

	  - Tweaked margins and padding of all elements, Plone should be
	  symmetrical again ;)

	  declaration. This means that no templates should have their own
	  declaration.	- Removed all references to the base slot from
	  existing templates, they were all just using it to set the
	  noborder variable anyway.  - Refactored main_template HEAVILY, it
	  contains no logic anymore, only structure.  - Moved all the
	  different parts into scripts or templates outside main_template -
	  Generic cleanup of a lot of bad templates
