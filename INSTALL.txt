For nicer install docs, try http://plone.org/documentation. They are more up to
date, and have nice and funky pictures to go with them ;)

**Download the following:**

- "Latest Zope":http://www.zope.org/Products (you need at least version 2.4, version 2.5 recommended)

- "Latest CMF":http://cmf.zope.org/download (you need at least version 1.2)

- "Latest Plone":http://plone.org/download

  - Plone comes with 3 Products that need to be installed in the Products directory: CMFPlone, DCWorkflow and Formulator.

**The installation procedure:**

- Install Zope (2.5.1 or later)

- Unpack the CMF directories (CMFCore, CMFDefault etc) into your Products directory (CMF1.3b2 or later)

- Unpack the Plone directory (CMFPlone) into your Products directory (also include the DCWorkflow and Formulator products)

- Start Zope

- From /manage interface there should be a 'Select Type to Add' that says, Plone Site.  click on that, fill in information and voila!

- This means that installation of Plone was successful. Go to the front page, and have a look at your new Plone site :)

- Have fun, and don't forget to report any bugs or inconsistencies in the "Skin Tracker.":http://www.zope.org/Members/runyaga/skinTracker 

Thank you for helping us improve Plone!
