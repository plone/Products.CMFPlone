Changelog
=========

1.1.9 - unreleased
------------------


1.1.8 - 2009-03-07
------------------

- Adjust the caching of sitemap.xml.gz. We only cache for anonymous users. That
  fixes a bug where a cached sitemap.xml.gz is delivered with information that
  only an user with more privilegs is allowed to see. We also make sure that
  the cached file was build with a current catalog by adding the catalog
  counter to the cache key. Based on a patch by stxnext. Fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8402.
  [stxnext, csenger]

- Added time_only for use with toLocalizedTime so that event_view now localizes
  the start/end times if the start/end dates are the same. Closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8607.
  [jnelson, calvinhp]

- Fixed Plone 3.1 backward compatibility of above.
  [stefan]


1.1.7 - December 15, 2008
-------------------------

- Modified user profile item on the dashboard to use an image tag
  instead of a background image. This makes it more consistent with
  the other list items and easier to style for RTL scripts.
  [emanlove]

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8323
  [calvinhp]

- Refactor default_page: move all logic out of the view to separate methods
  so they can be called without a request (which is not used at all). 
  Deprecate parameters which were not in the interface and were never used.
  [wichert]

- Added note that Javascript is required for presentation mode. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7575 and
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7573
  [limi]

  have a portal_type.  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8028.
  [davisagli]

  portal_type. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8246.
  [hannosch]

- Adjusted deprecation warnings to point to Plone 4.0 instead of Plone 3.5
  since we changed the version numbering again.
  [hannosch]

1.1.3 Released July 7th, 2008
------------------------------

- Made PersonalBarViewlet tolerate users who don't have a Plone user object, as
  when using OpenID or apachepas. This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7296.
  [erikrose]

- Use 'index' attribute rather than 'render' for setting viewlet templates, so that
  they can be overridden using the 'template' ZCML attribute.
  [davisagli]

1.1.0 Released April 20th, 2008
-------------------------------

- Applied patch from http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7942 to ensure that the
  'currentParent' marker is not True for items that have a path that is a 
  substring of the true path.
  [optilude]

- Displaying 'Anonymous User' also when the comment creator is an empty
  string. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7712.
  [rsantos]

- Allow the use of the icon attribute on action directly instead of using the
  actionicons tool.
  [hannosch]

- Fix invalid leading space in all 'Up to Site Setup' links.
  [wichert]

- Fixed permission in workflow history viewlet. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5507.
  [hannosch]

- Made handling of self.context in portal.py consistent.
  [hannosch]

- Rename the portal_url instance variable to site_url in the ViewletBase
  class. This prevents getToolByName(..., 'portal_url') from returning
  the URL string instead of the portal_url tool, which can causes unexpected
  and subtle breakage. portal_url is still available but produces a deprecation
  warning. It will be removed in Plone 4.
  [wichert]

- Added viewlet for RSS link.
  [fschulze]

- Added dependency on plone.app.viewletmanager.
  [fschulze]

- Make viewlet managers in head section order- and filterable.
  [fschulze]

  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7537.
  [hannosch]

- Catch KeyError for presentation or tableContents when document
  has an out-of-date schema.  Can happen when migrating from Plone
  2.5 to 3.0. Fall back to False for those attributes then.
  [maurits]


1.0.5 Released January 3rd, 2008
--------------------------------

- Do not create an empty <ul> in the personal actions bar if there are
  no items in it. This fixes an XHTML syntax error.
  [wichert]

  [martior]

- Allow non ascii characters in webstats_js code.

  also anonymous users.
  This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7250.
  [rsantos]


1.0.3 Released November 9, 2007
--------------------------------

- Made getIcon urls relative to portal root.
  [tesdal]


1.0.2 Released October 8th, 2007

  of getting the correct url.
  [optilude]

  http://www.sitemaps.org and fixed the caching to use the filename.

  on each view.

  in languages with a rather long term.

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6810
