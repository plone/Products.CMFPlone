4.2rc1 (2012-05-07)
-------------------

  @@plone_portal_state/friendly_types, since that excludes non-searchable
  types rather than non-listable types.
  [davisagli]

- PloneControlPanel's enumConfiglets no longer returns invisible configlets.
  [esteele]

- Hide the (old) Collections control panel by default for new sites.
  [esteele]

  [smcmahon]

- Decode id and bad characters in check_id script with default_encoding to
  prevent UnicodeDecodeError when bad characters contains non-ascii letters.

- Re-apply PLIP 10901 to table_sort.js, fixing a bug with reversing sort
  on the first column.
  [mj]

- Add keyword 'latest' to metadata.xml's version tag, which then looks for
  the highest numbered profile that is registered and pins that to the
  upgrade step. This means that the version field in metadata.xml only
  has to be set to 'latest' once and then it automatically searches for
  the highest numbered profile.
  [eleddy]
