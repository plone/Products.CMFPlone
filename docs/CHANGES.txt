------------------

  [vincentfretin]

- Ensure some transient dependencies don't vanish in the 4.2 series,
  just because some libraries get updated and nobody declares the

  zope.copypastemove, zope.app.component, zope.app.container,
  zope.app.publisher.
  [maurits]

  [cwainwright]

  [erral]


4.2 (2012-06-29)
----------------

- Add upgrade step to install the CMFEditions component registry bases
  modifier.
  [rossp]

- Make redirection_view/attempt_redirect fall back to nothing in
  default_error_message template. If plone.app.redirector gets a URL with
  special characters, OOBTree.get raises a UnicodeDecodeError and the template
  fails. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12976.
  [timo]

- Fix jquery.highlightsearchterms.js to not render arbitrary js.
  [vangheem]


4.2rc2 (2012-05-31)
-------------------

- Check the existence of a portal_type attribute before accessing it to construct
  navigation URLs. This avoids an exception when constructing breadcrumb navigation
  for search results if the result is a 'Discussion Item' as the parent Conversation
  object does not have a portal_type attribute.
  [gaudenz]

- For event view template, changed headerless table to headings and divs for better accessibility. See bug #13181
  [hmharter]

- Add translatable js message for closing popup boxes.

- calculate the dynamic fontsize in s5_slides.js (Presentation Mode) in em, not px. This for WCAG 2.0 compliance.
  See http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12902
  [polyester]

- When adding, changing or removing skins, automatically recook all resource
  registries, to keep theme bundles in-sync. This mirrors the event subscriber
  support used in plone.app.registry for the same purpose.
  [hannosch]

- Let the RR export/import steps depend on the skins tool and
  plone.app.registry steps, as either of them might create new theme bundles
  [hannosch]

- Hide Kupu base profile on Plone site creation screen.
  [hannosch]

- PEP 8 (ignoring W602, W604, E301, E302, E501 and E701).
  [hvelarde]

  forms with more than 6 tabs.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12877
  [davidjb]

  activated by default. Event finds new products installed with 
  the latest keyword and updates them to the last profile version.
  [eleddy]

4.2rc1 (2012-05-07)
-------------------

- Fix an outdated "Send this" form handler property reference.
  [rossp]

- removed search_form-template form plone_deprecated-skin. Use
  collective.searchform if you need this functionality.
  [tom_gross]

- Use plone.batching for all batches (PLIP #12235)
  [tom_gross]

- Re-apply PLIP 10901 to table_sort.js, fixing a bug with reversing sort
  on the first column.
  [mj]

- Stop filtering folder_listing to the types from
  @@plone_portal_state/friendly_types, since that excludes non-searchable
  types rather than non-listable types.
  [davisagli]

- PloneControlPanel's enumConfiglets no longer returns invisible configlets.
  [esteele]

- Hide the (old) Collections control panel by default for new sites.
  [esteele]

- Use getId() instead of title_or_id() for displaying which items get
  deleted, to avoid unicode error
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12765
  [spereverde]

- Allow form tabbing to be used across different DOM documents.
  [rossp]

- Decode id and bad characters in check_id script with default_encoding to
  prevent UnicodeDecodeError when bad characters contains non-ascii letters.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12525
  [pingviini]

- Re-apply PLIP 10901 to table_sort.js, fixing a bug with reversing sort
  on the first column.
  [mj]

- Add keyword 'latest' to metadata.xml's version tag, which then looks for
  the highest numbered profile that is registered and pins that to the
  upgrade step. This means that the version field in metadata.xml only
  has to be set to 'latest' once and then it automatically searches for
  the highest numbered profile.
  [eleddy]

4.2b2 (2012-02-09)
------------------

- Changed link from search to @@search for the "More" link in livesearch_reply.

  [kleist, suggested by keul]

- IE critical fix on toggle select and form submit helpers.
  [thomasdesvenain]

- Fixed the two high priority scenarios (global sections viewlet and nav
  portlet) of http://dev.plone.org/ticket/11189.
  [fulv]

- Call the view to unlock an item on unload synchronously, so that the
  call succeeds on Webkit browsers. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/ticket/7885
  [davisagli]

- Remove uneeded kss debugging code
  [jfroche]

- Allow users with the Manage Users permission to change the login
  name of other users; specifically this allows them to change the
  email address when this is used as login name.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11255
  [maurits]

- Removed the 'What' row in the event view that displayed the
  keywords; this is already handled by the keywords viewlet.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10818
  [maurits]

- Make control panel action GS export return actions alphabetically since
  there is no other natural ordering.
  [ggozad]

- Fixed folder_listing template
  so that listing macro can be used outside of folder_listing.
  [thomasdesvenain]

  acquisition path, as reserved.

  [rochecompaan]

4.2a2 - 2011-08-25
------------------

- AuthenticatedUsers group is used for local roles etc, and is not the same
  as Authenticated role. Thus, it can not be optimized away in catalog queries.

  [do3cc]

------------------

  Part of a form accessibility cleanup.
  [smcmahon]

- Removed registration of the input-label.js from the portal_javascript tool.
  Those with a desperate need to support the 'placeholder' text functionality
  in the obsolete browsers are free to re-register the script in their own
  instances.
  [spliter]

- Deprecated input-label.js — instead we are using the HTML5 'placeholder'
  attribute on the input fields.
  [spliter]

- Deprecated IEFixes.css after we have introduced Modernizr and removed it's
  GS registration. References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11300
