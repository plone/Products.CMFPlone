  [thomasdesvenain]

  [elro]

- Deprecated the following scripts that are only used by deprecated templates.
  These will be removed in Plone 5: prefs_group_edit.py,
  prefs_valid_search_restriction.py, prefs_user_group_search.py,
  prefs_portrait_delete.py.
  [davisagli]

- Replaced the prefs_group_details.pt template with a browser view in
  plone.app.controlpanel. Ss a side effect this means group creation is now
  protected by the Plone Users and Groups control panel permission, rather than
  the CMF Manage Groups permission.
  [davisagli]

- Turn plone_control_panel.pt into a deprecated alias for the
  @@overview-controlpanel view from plone.app.controlpanel.
  [davisagli]

- Protect most control panels with specific permissions instead of the generic
  "Manage portal".
  [davisagli]

- Configure the Site Administrator role in the default rolemap and workflows.
  This role is intended for people who should have full content editing
  privileges but not Manager access (i.e. to the ZMI).
  [davisagli]

- Updated to use Zope 2.13.
