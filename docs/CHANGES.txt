4.3a1 (2012-08-31)
------------------

- Hide 'plone.resource' and 'collective.z3cform.datetimewidget' from the
  site factory screen. These are only useful as dependencies of other packages.
  [optilude]

  [thomasdesvenain]

- IE critical fix on toggle select and form submit helpers.
  [thomasdesvenain]

- Fixed javascript injections on jquery.highlightsearchterms.js
  [gborelli]

- Tweak rules for `sortable_title`. So far we took the first 70 chars and
  zero-padded numbers to six digits. Now we zero-pad to four digits and take
  the first 30 and the last 10 characters, thus saving space while still
  distinguishing long titles which only differ at the end, like imported
  file or image names.
  [hannosch]

- PEP 8 (ignoring W602, E203, E241, E301, E501 and E701).
  [pbdiode, hvelarde]

  order to finish PLIP #8699: Display publication date in author byline.
  [vipod]

- Deprecated aliases were replaced on tests.
  [hvelarde]

- Don't register the plone_deprecated skin layer. These items are no
  longer supported as part of Plone and remain here temporarily as a
  convenience to those who may need to move them into their own
  packages.
  [davisagli]

- Ensure multiple tabbed forms on the same page work when number of
  tabs is greater than threshold.
  [davidjb]

- Remove deprecated `jq` reference from form tabbing JavaScript.
  [davidjb]

- Remove incorrect line of form tabbing JavaScript which broke
  forms with more than 6 tabs.
  Fixes https://dev.plone.org/ticket/12877
  [davidjb]

  [tom_gross]

- support a PAS plugin for validating passwords
  PLIP http://dev.plone.org/ticket/10959
  [djay75]

- Make redirection_view/attempt_redirect fall back to nothing in
  default_error_message template. If plone.app.redirector gets a URL with
  special characters, OOBTree.get raises a UnicodeDecodeError and the template
  fails. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12976.

- Channel link in RSS feed now points to the un-syndicated content for the RSS feed,
  instead of the portal root.
  [patch by pydanny, applied by kleist]

  from "/portal_properties/site_properties".
  Fixes https://dev.plone.org/ticket/11171.
