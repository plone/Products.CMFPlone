Changelog
=========

4.3.10 (unreleased)
-------------------

- New:

- *add item here*

Fixes:

- Render an empty ``<dd>`` tag on ``folder_listing`` template when no description is available to avoid validation issues.
  [hvelarde]

- Removed docstrings from PropertyManager methods to avoid publishing them.  [maurits]

- Added publishing patch from Products.PloneHotfix20160419.
  This avoids publishing some methods inherited from Zope or CMF.  [maurits]

- Removed docstrings from some methods to avoid publishing them.  [maurits]

- Ensured front-page is English when creating an English site.
  Previously, when creating an English site with a browser that
  prefers a different language, the body text ended up being in the
  browser language.  For languages without a front-page text
  translation the same happened: they got the other language instead
  of English.  [maurits]


4.3.9 (2016-03-29)
------------------

- No changes


4.3.8 (2016-03-08)
------------------

Fixes:

- Add dl.portalMessage.warning to common_content_filter in popupforms.js so
  warnings get also pulled into the popup. [pcdummy]

- Disabled CSRF protection on site creation form and upgrade form.  [maurits]

- When migration fails, do not upgrade addons or recatalog or
  update roles.
  [maurits]

- Let plone-final import step also depend on the workflow step.
  Otherwise the plone-final step installs plone.app.discussion with an
  extra workflow, and then our own workflow step throws it away again.
  Closes `#1041`_.
  [maurits]

- Purge profile upgrade versions from portal_setup when applying our
  default CMFPlone:plone profile.  This signals that nothing has been
  installed yet, so depencies will get reapplied instead of possibly
  upgraded.  This could cause problems mostly in tests.  Closes
  `#1041`_.
  [maurits]

- Add syndication for plone.app.contenttypes collections.
  [do3cc]

- Add CSRF authenticator in createObject script
  [ebrehault]

- Let set_own_login_name use the update(Own)LoginName method from PAS.
  Part of PLIP 13419.
  [maurits]

  [gotcha]

  [vangheem]

4.3.5 (2015-05-13)
------------------

  an IPTC standard that provides a media-type-independent, structural framework for multi-media news.
  [frapell, jpgimenez, tcurvelo]

- Add tests for configuring encoding of user registration or
  forgotten password emails.
  [davidjb]

- Pass email encoding to forgotten password email template.
  [davidjb]

- Pass mail ``Content-Type`` to mailhost when sending forgotten password
  emails.
  [davidjb]

- Fix: If a user "deletes" the same item twice (ex.: having two different tabs
  open and not realising it's already been deleted) any higher level item with
  the same short name will be deleted without trace.
  [gotcha]

- Extended ulocalized_time for target_language

  [fRiSi]

  [maurits]

  extend the search portlet with custom views or other actions.

  the first 30 and the last 10 characters, thus saving space while still
  distinguishing long titles which only differ at the end, like imported
  file or image names.

  PLIP http://dev.plone.org/ticket/10959
  [djay75]

- Make redirection_view/attempt_redirect fall back to nothing in
  default_error_message template. If plone.app.redirector gets a URL with
  special characters, OOBTree.get raises a UnicodeDecodeError and the template
  fails. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12976.

- Channel link in RSS feed now points to the un-syndicated content for the RSS feed,
  instead of the portal root.
