How to upgrade a Plone site to a newer version
==============================================

This is a short version; more information can be found at
http://plone.org/upgrade.

1. Stop Plone / Zope

2. Always back up your Plone site. You should back up:

    * Your Data.fs which contains your site data
    * Any file system files you have modified
    * Your blob storage

3. Install the new version of Plone.
   The latest version of Plone is always available from
   http://plone.org/download and your install will depend upon your particular
   setup.

4. Restart Plone / Zope

5. Open up the Zope root folder in a browser. It will show you an overview of
   all installed Plone sites and tell you which ones need to be upgraded.
   Follow the onscreen instructions.

Running the upgrade may:

 * Change values you have set in the ZODB (actions and properties, for example)

 * Re-catalog your portal_catalog; this may be time-consuming

 * Reapply security to objects; this may be time-consuming

If you have issues please search for an update of your Python, Zope, Plone and
third-party add-ons and read http://plone.org/upgrade.

If you still have issues please the use the bug tracker at
https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues and include:

 * your Python version
 * the platform
 * the Plone versions you are upgrading to and from
 * most importantly: the full traceback and upgrade log

Try to provide as much information as possible.
