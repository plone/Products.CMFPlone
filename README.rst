Technical overview
------------------

Plone is a content management platform written in Python.
It builds upon Zope, an Open Source web application server and development system and thus on the pluggable Zope Component Architecture (ZCA).

Python is the easy-to-learn, widely-used and supported Open Source programming language.
Python can be used to add new features to Plone, and used to understand or make changes to the way that Plone works.

Plone stores its contents in Zope's built-in transactional hierachical object database, the ZODB.
The ZODB can be connected to simple file-storages, scalable ZEO-Servers or Postgres, MySQL and Oracle.
There are addon and techniques, however, to share information with other sources, such as relational databases, LDAP, filesystem
files, etc.
