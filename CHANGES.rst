5.2.3.rc1 (2020-10-30)
----------------------

Bug fixes:


- No longer doubly undo a response Content-Type change when combining bundles.
  [maurits] (#1924)
- Fix issue with @@search view when filtering by creation date
  [frapell] (#3007)
- Fixed use of own ``utils.isDefaultPage``, which should be ``defaultpage.check_default_page_via_view``.
  [maurits] (#3130)
- Fixed invalid escape sequences in regular expressions.
  [maurits] (#3130)
- Fixed deprecation warning for zope.site.hooks.
  [maurits] (#3130)
- PloneBatch: define ``__bool__`` as copy of ``__nonzero__``.
  Python 3 calls ``__bool__`` when doing ``bool(batch)``.
  [maurits] (#3175)
- No longer consider calling ``len(batch)`` as deprecated.
  The deprecation warning is unvoidable with current ``Products.PageTemplates`` code.
  Fixes `issue 3176 <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/3176>`_.
  maurits (#3176)
- Fix tests with Products.MailHost 4.10.
  [maurits] (#3178)
- Robot tests: Do not use jQuery.size() but use ``.length`` instead.
  ``.size()`` is deprecated since 1.8.
  [thet] (#3195)


5.2.2 (2020-08-16)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- Release Plone 5.2.2 final.
  No changes with last release candidate, except that the versions will contain Products.isurlinportal 1.1.0 with a minor security hardening fix.
  [maurits] (#3510)


5.2.2rc3 (2020-08-16)
---------------------

Bug fixes:


- Return a Zope aware engine for page templates based on ``zope.pagetemplate`` instead of ``Products.PageTemplates``.
  Fixes possible problems with such templates, for example z3c.form ones, with Zope 4.4 and higher.
  See `issue 3141 <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/3141>`_.
  [maurits] (#3141)
- Depend on new package ``Products.isurlinportal``.
  This contains the ``isURLInPortal`` method that was split off from our ``URLTool``.
  See `issue 3150 <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/3150>`_.
  [maurits] (#3150)
- Redirection view: refactor our navigation root editing to a separate method ``edit_for_navigation_root``.
  Since Plone 5.2 the redirectiontool respects INavigationroot:
  with a manual redirect you cannot enter a path starting with ``/`` which 'escapes' the NavigationRoot to the SiteRoot to link to another part of the Plone instance.
  This refactor makes it possible to override this method to return the redirection unchanged, brining back the pre Plone 5.2 behavior of the ``Products.RedirectionTool`` add-on.
  [maurits] (#3153)
- Control panel configlets: first check visibility, then check condition.
  Visibility is cheaper to check.
  Also fixes `bug 3154 <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/3154>`_.
  [maurits] (#3154)


5.2.2rc2 (2020-07-17)
---------------------

Bug fixes:


- Fix an issue in mail_password_template.pt in the message showing the ip to really try the request.REMOTE_ADDR variable if request.HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR is empty (when you're not behind apache or nginx).
  [vincentfretin] (#2949)
- mail_password form: Do not crash if the userid is not provided or the user doesn't have an email configured
  [frapell] (#3008)


5.2.2rc1 (2020-06-28)
---------------------

  [thet] (#2887)

- Fix index_html on PortalRoot: ReplaceableWrapper did not work.
  [jensens] (#3060)
- Allow accessing ``plone_view.patterns_settings``.
  This was no problem until now, but a newer ``Zope/zope.tales/Chameleon``  is rightly stricter.
  [maurits] (#3066)
- Fix Python 3.8 ``time.clock`` removal in CatalogTool [jensens] (#3082)
- Fixed TypeError when adding both a group and a user to a group.
  [maurits] (#3084)
- Make the resource registry scripts output more robust when a bundle resource is missing. This prevents
  breaking your whole Plone site and access to the resource registry control panel after inserting
  one missing resource. 
  [fredvd] (#3096)
- Bugfix for #3103
  [petschki] (#3105)

Bug fixes:


- Switched allowedRolesAndUsers indexer from 'View' to the correct permission

  [pbauer] (#2258)

- New robot tests for querystring in Collection type. Now almost all
  querystring types are robot tested. [llisa123] (#2489)
- Add ``load_async`` and ``load_defer`` attributes to resource registries
  bundle settings. When set, ``<script>`` tags are rendered with
  ``async="async"`` resp. ``defer="defer"`` attributes. You also need to empty
  the ``merge_with`` property of your bundle, because production bundles
  (``default.js`` and ``logged-in.js``) are never loaded with async or defer.
  The default.js includes jQuery and requirejs and those are needed at many
  places and therefore cannot be loaded asynchronously. Refs: #2649, #2657.
