5.1a1 (2016-03-31)
------------------

Incompatibilities:

- Changed these ``section`` elements to ``div`` elements: ``#viewlet-above-content``, ``#viewlet-above-content-body``, ``#content-core``, ``#viewlet-below-content-body``.
  And these portlets ``section`` elements to ``aside`` elements: ``#portal-colophon``, ``#portal-footer-signature``.
  This might affect your custom styling or javascript.
  [maurits]

New:

- Upgrade to tinymce to 4.3.4
  [vangheem]

- For the controlpanel portlets, use the nearest site url as a base for the overview-controlpanel.
  This gives more flexibility for sub site controlpanels.
  [thet]

- added invisible-grid table styles
  [agitator]

- Control panel to mange portal actions
  [ebrehault]

- new less variable to configure the width of the toolbars submenu called ``plone-toolbar-submenu-width``.
  [jensens]

- new zcml feature "plone-51" added. Profile version set to 5101.
  Version references set to 5.1.0.
  [jensens]

- Registered post_handler instead of plone-final.  The plone-final
  import step now does nothing.  Instead, we redefined the old handler
  as a post_handler explicitly for our main profile.  This is
  guaranteed to really run after all other import steps, which was
  never possible in the old way.  The plone-final step is kept for
  backwards compatibility.
  [maurits]

- Remove Zope mention in logout form
  [tkimnguyen]

- Do not encode reply-to email address for contact-info form
  [tkimnguyen]

Fixes:

- Fixed displaying the body text of a feed item.  This is when
  ``render_body`` is switched on in the Syndication settings.
  [maurits]

- Make Gruntfile.js generation script a bit more verbose to show the effective
  locations of the generated bundles. This helps in case of non-working setups
  also as if bundle compilation was started in browser at a first run a and
  next run was run using the script and files were generated at different
  places than expected.
  [jensens]

- Ensured front-page is English when creating an English site.
  Previously, when creating an English site with a browser that
  prefers a different language, the body text ended up being in the
  browser language.  For languages without a front-page text
  translation the same happened: they got the other language instead
  of English.  [maurits]

- Fixed test error in ``test_controlpanel_site.py`` failed with random error.
  [jensens]

- Do not break background images relative urls in CSS when concatening bundles
  [ebrehault]

- Fixed html validation: element nav does not need a role attribute.
  [maurits]

- Fixed html validation: section lacks heading.
  [maurits]



5.0.3 (2016-03-??)
------------------

Fixes:

- In the ``combine-bundles`` import step, make sure the Content Type
  header is not set to ``application/javascript``.  This would result
  in the ``plone-upgrade`` result page being shown in plain text.
  Fixes https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/1436
  [maurits]

  [maurits]

- Purge profile upgrade versions from portal_setup when applying our
  default CMFPlone:plone profile.  This signals that nothing has been

  forgotten password emails.

  anymore.

  [thet]

- Remove ``selectable_views`` from ``properties.xml``, which isn't used
  anywhere anymore.
  [thet]

  ``propertiestool.xml``. This setting is now done in
  ``plone.app.contenttypes`` respectively ``Products.ATContentTypes``.
  [thet]

- Add __version__ attribute to __init__.py. This allows us to retrieve the
  current Plone version with 'Products.CMFPlone.__version__'. Even though this

  this.
  [timo]

  a dependency.
  [rpatterson]

  certain method calls in order to make debugging of robottests easier:
  w/o it shows 1000ds of extra lines in html report.
