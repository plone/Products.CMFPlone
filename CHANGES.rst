  965 <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/965>`_.
  [maurits]

- The related items widget has changed a lot.
  See the Mockup changelog for 2.4.0 here: https://github.com/plone/mockup/blob/master/CHANGES.rst

- All css classes named ``enableUnloadProtection`` were changed to ``pat-formunloadalert`` to trigger that pattern.

  [gforcada]

  [thet]

  [thet]

- Move ``get_top_site_from_url`` from plone.app.content to ``utils.py`` and make it robust against unicode paths.
  This function allows in virtual hosting environments to acquire the top most visible portal object to operate on.
  It is used for example to calculate the correct virtual root objects for Mockup's related items and structure pattern.
  [thet]

- Add sort_on field to search controlpanel.
  [rodfersou]

- PLIP 1340: Deprecate portal_quickinstaller.

  Products.Five.bbb.AcquisitionBBB as a parent-class and thus no __of__.
  Anyway __of__ in AcquisitionBBB always only returned self since
  Products.Five.browser.metaconfigure.xxx-classes are always aq-wrapped
  using location and __parent__. As a alternative you could use
  plone.app.registry.browser.controlpanel.ControlPanelFormWrapper as
  base-class for a controlpanel since ControlPanelFormWrapper subclasses
  Products.Five.BrowserView which again has AcquisitionBBB.
  [pbauer]

- Let npm install work on windows for plone-compile-resources.
  [jensens]

- Don't fail, when combining bundles and the target resource files (``BUNLDE-compiled.[min.js|css]``) do not yet exist on the filesystem.

5.1a1 (2016-03-31)
------------------

Incompatibilities:

- Changed these ``section`` elements to ``div`` elements: ``#viewlet-above-content``, ``#viewlet-above-content-body``, ``#content-core``, ``#viewlet-below-content-body``.
  And these portlets ``section`` elements to ``aside`` elements: ``#portal-colophon``, ``#portal-footer-signature``.
  This might affect your custom styling or javascript.
  [maurits]

New:

- Upgrade to tinymce to 4.3.4
  [vangheem]

- For the controlpanel portlets, use the nearest site url as a base for the overview-controlpanel.
  This gives more flexibility for sub site controlpanels.
  [thet]

- added invisible-grid table styles
  [agitator]

- Control panel to mange portal actions
  [ebrehault]

- new less variable to configure the width of the toolbars submenu called ``plone-toolbar-submenu-width``.
  [jensens]

- new zcml feature "plone-51" added. Profile version set to 5101.
  Version references set to 5.1.0.
  [jensens]

- Registered post_handler instead of plone-final.  The plone-final
  import step now does nothing.  Instead, we redefined the old handler
  as a post_handler explicitly for our main profile.  This is
  guaranteed to really run after all other import steps, which was
  never possible in the old way.  The plone-final step is kept for
  backwards compatibility.
  [maurits]

- Remove Zope mention in logout form
  [tkimnguyen]

- Do not encode reply-to email address for contact-info form
  [tkimnguyen]

Fixes:

- Fixed displaying the body text of a feed item.  This is when
  ``render_body`` is switched on in the Syndication settings.
  [maurits]

- Make Gruntfile.js generation script a bit more verbose to show the effective
  locations of the generated bundles. This helps in case of non-working setups
  also as if bundle compilation was started in browser at a first run a and
  next run was run using the script and files were generated at different
  places than expected.
  [jensens]

- Ensured front-page is English when creating an English site.
  Previously, when creating an English site with a browser that
  prefers a different language, the body text ended up being in the
  browser language.  For languages without a front-page text
  translation the same happened: they got the other language instead
  of English.  [maurits]

- Fixed test error in ``test_controlpanel_site.py`` failed with random error.
  [jensens]

- Do not break background images relative urls in CSS when concatening bundles
  [ebrehault]

- Fixed html validation: element nav does not need a role attribute.
  [maurits]

- Fixed html validation: section lacks heading.
