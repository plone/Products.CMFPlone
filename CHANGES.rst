6.0.0a1 (2021-10-22)
--------------------

Bug fixes:


- Release Plone 6.0.0a1.
  No changes since previous release.
  [maurits] (#3341)


6.0.0a1.dev1 (2021-10-16)
-------------------------

Bug fixes:


- Use HTML5 meta charset.
  [malthe] (#2025)
- add icon_expr to view/edit action for @@iconresolver
  [petschki] (#3327)
- Set the "Show excluded items" (``show_excluded_items``) to False per default.
  Setting it to ``True`` can introduce a performance problem.
  ``False`` should be the default, also from user expectation for the ``exclude_from_nav`` setting on content items.
  No upgrade step!
  Previous behavior is just kept, unless you override it manually.
  See: #3055, first comment.
  Use this registry snippet to set it false::

      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <registry>
        <records prefix="plone" interface="Products.CMFPlone.interfaces.controlpanel.INavigationSchema">
          <value key="show_excluded_items">False</value>
        </records>
      </registry>
