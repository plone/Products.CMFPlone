1.0a3 - 2009-12-16
------------------

- Make the password field optional for the admin when instead an email
  can be sent.
  [maurits]

- On the anonymous registration form, do not offer to send an email
  with a link to reset your password if the password fields are right
  there on the form already; we were never actually sending emails
  with the plain password itself anyway.
  [maurits]

- Allow admins to register a user at all times, also without valid
  mailhost settings.  This means that in a fresh Plone site you can
  create user accounts immediately without having to edit any
  settings.

  practice. This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6480.

  configlets in "Users and Groups" control panel. Ref. #9825

  site settings. 
  [esteele]

- Change registration form name @@join_form to @@register. Change class names
  accordingly. Added an "@@new-user" form to be used from the control panel.
  "Add to group" functionality now lives there. We can now get rid of the 
  horrid came_from flags that we've been passing around.
  [esteele]

  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/attachment/ticket/9810
  [vincentfretin]
