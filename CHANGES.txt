Changelog
=========

1.1b2 - 2011-03-02
------------------

- Fixed test of the default user portrait, which changed from
  defaultUser.gif to defaultUser.png in Products.PlonePAS 4.0.5.
  [maurits]

1.1b1 - 2011-01-03
------------------

- Depend on ``Products.CMFPlone`` instead of ``Plone``.
  [elro]

- Don't allow non-Managers to add new users to groups that grant the Manager
  role.
  [davisagli]

- Protect the user management forms with the
  "Plone Site Setup: Users and Groups" permission instead of the generic
  "Manage portal" and "Manage users".  This requires
  plone.app.controlpanel >= 2.1b1.

1.0.4 - 2011-02-25
------------------

  defaultUser.png in Products.PlonePAS 4.0.5. 
  [maurits]

1.0.3 - 2011-01-03
------------------

- Don't assume that fields in the user schema will be saved in property sheets
  when a new user registers. Instead, adapt the navigation root to the user
  schema to get the same adapter as is used on the Personal Information form,
  and use it to save the values from the registration form.
  [davisagli]

- Fixed critical error on add user page
  when some groups have a non-ascii character in their title.
  Sort groups on their title normalized.
  Token and value in terms in the groups vocabulary were switched.

  can be sent.
  [maurits]

  there on the form already; we were never actually sending emails
  with the plain password itself anyway.
  [maurits]

  mailhost settings.  This means that in a fresh Plone site you can
  create user accounts immediately without having to edit any
  settings.
  [maurits]

  practice. This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6480.

- @@new-user form will now always show the password fields, regardless of the
  site settings.

  "Add to group" functionality now lives there. We can now get rid of the
  horrid came_from flags that we've been passing around.
  [esteele]

- Internationalized title_join_form_fields and description_join_form_fields.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/attachment/ticket/9810
  [vincentfretin]
