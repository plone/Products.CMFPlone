  [maurits]

- Really make the dependency of the markup control panel on wicked optional.
  [vincentfretin]

  [thet]


2.2.2 (2011-10-17)

  [stefan]


2.2.1 (2011-08-23)

  [esteele]


2.1.2 (2011-09-16)
------------------

- Introduced an update method in GroupMembershipControlPanel and
  UserMembershipControlPanel to seperate setting of variables and template
  rendering, so it is possible to subclass those classes to add new
  functionnalities.
  [vincentfretin]

- Fixed canAddToGroup check in usergroups_usermembership view, apparently 
  a bad copy and paste from the old prefs_search_macros. It checked against
  the authenticated user instead of the member we're currently looking at.
  [vincentfretin]

- On usergroup-groupmembership view, check for each found principal that it
  can be added to the group. Previously it checked that authenticated user can
  be added to the group, that is non sense.
  [vincentfretin]

  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11901
  [WouterVH]

----------------

- Make the dependency of the markup control panel on wicked optional.
  [davisagli]

- Remove hidden `form.submitted` field in the form wrapping the "Add New User"
  button on the groups overview page. The presence of that field forces a

- Fixed : Group titles were not display on group prefs page
  when title property was got from mutable properties plugin.
  [thomasdesvenain]

- Prevent privilege escalation when access to the Users and Groups control
  panel is given to non-Manager users.  Only users with the "Manage portal"

  the Manager role. Also, non-Managers cannot edit the roles of, reset the
  password of, or delete users or groups with the Manager role.
  [davisagli]

- Declare dependency on Zope2 >= 2.13.0.
  [davisagli]

- Protect each control panel using its own specific permission, instead of the
  generic "Manage portal". This way access to particular control panels can be
  delegated.
  [davisagli]

  plone_control_panel.pt in CMFPlone.

  [cah190]

- Added use_email_as_login property to security control panel.
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9214

  [davisagli]


1.1.3 - 2009-03-07
------------------

- "Mark external links" and "External links open in new window" were not working
  independently ('mark' had to be set for 'new window' to work) and marking could
  not be turned off at all (#7383). Fixed by having either one enable the js
  support and adding a new site property to control marking. Implemented so
  that new site property will be assumed false if missing and created on change
  if missing -- so no migration required. There is a matching change in Plone
  app in a couple of javascripts.
  [smcmahon]

- 'Enable User Folders' in the security control panel supports
  create/delete a 'My Folder' link user action know from Plone 2.*
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8417

  CMFEditions settings.
  [wichert]

- Added checkbox for enabling/disabling inline editing.
  [fschulze]

- Simplified the mail control panel to present all information on one tab.
  In case of validation errors the panel behaved in most unintuitive ways.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7425,
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7694 and
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6916.

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7008.
  [hannosch]


1.0.4 -  2008-02-13
-------------------

- Take advantage of NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE to be independent of the tidy_html
  transform.
  [shh42]

- Fixed vocabulary in skins control panel to support proper i18n.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7766.
  [hannosch]

- Changed import of FormFieldsets to avoid a deprecation warning.
  [hannosch]

  [limi]


1.0 - 2007-08-14
----------------

  real workflow. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6843
  (yes, that bug again).
  [wichert]

- Fixed the translation of type names on the search and markup control
  panels. This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6911.
  [hannosch]

- The UI allowed to disable country-specific language variants even if
  one was still active as the default language. You get a nice error
  message now. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6862.
  [hannosch]

- Use checkboxes instead of a evil MultiSelect for the wiki settings.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6872 for real.
  [hannosch]

- Internationalized the workflow part of the types control panel. All
  descriptions, states and titles should be translated now.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed order of types in the dropdown. We sort by translated title now.
  [hannosch]

- When updating the default workflow do not reset the workflow for types
  using the default workflow to the new default workflow. This fixes
  the last part of http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6843.
  [wichert]

- Handle changing the workflow from a type to the default workflow if the
  default workflow is the same as the previous workflow correctly. This
  fixes part of http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6843.
  [wichert]

- When we remap the default workflow change the default workflow in
  the workflow tool as well. This fixes part of

-------------------

- Fixed missing history entries.
  [hannosch]

-------------------

- Add a description to the no-workflow fallback. This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6812.
  [wichert]

- Filter control panel doesn't warn you when you haven't saved your changes
  Added enableUnloadFormProtection class to the control panel form.
  This references http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6654.
  [duncan]

- Removed lots of irrelevant options from the language control panel. The
  selection of the default language could use a simpler widget, but it's
  too late to change that now. All advanced options should be made
  available through control panels in add-ons which actually use these
  settings. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6784.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed various bugs in the LanguageTableWidget. Removed broken code that
  tried to show the country flags. Showing 150 flags is rather excessive.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6814.
  [hannosch]

- Removed multilingual content settings from the language control panel.
  These don't have any effect in a standard Plone site. LinguaPlone /
  plone.app.multilingual features its own control panel.
  [hannosch]


1.0rc1 - 2007-07-09
-------------------

- Do not show really user unfriendly types anymore in the search and types
  control panels. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6292.
  [hannosch]

- Consistently bicapitalized 'JavaScript'. This refs
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6636.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed another spelling error on the filter control panel. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6653.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed two spelling errors on the filter control panel. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6644.
  [hannosch]

- Added and used the new LanguageTableWidget for the available language
  listing.
  [hannosch]

- Use the new LanguageDropdownChoiceWidget for the default language field.
  [hannosch]

- Added first working version of the new language control panel. It still
  needs two new locale aware widgets for the language listings. This refs
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5442.
  [hannosch]

- Added support for optional descriptions on fieldsets.
  [hannosch]

- Added RAMCache control panel. You can invoke it via

  [hannosch]

- Localized the calendar control panel weekday names based on the Zope 3
  locales information, which is available from the portal_state view.
  [hannosch]

- Removed title customization from the types control panel. This is
  currently not possible in any i18n-safe way. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6551.
  [hannosch]


1.0b5 - 2007-05-05
------------------

- Fixed dummy on_save method to accept the data argument.
  [hannosch]


1.0b4 - 2007-05-05
------------------

- Pass data to the on-save template method.
  [optilude]

- Add a callback method from the save button handler. This makes it easier
  to react when saving is finished (successfully) - otherwise, the schema
  adapter properties are simple set one-by-one and you can't do anything
  when form saving is complete. The alternative is to override the button
  handler, but then we lose some of the consistency that plone.app.form
  tries to introduce.
  [optilude]

- Wording.
  [limi]


1.0b3 - 2007-05-01
------------------

- Adjusted the mail control panel to store the email settings on the portal
  root intead of in the site properties. This closes

------------------

- Spelling corrections and wording.
  [limi]
