  @@usergroup-groupmembership view.
  [esteele]


2.0b2 - 2010-01-25

  [calvinhp]

  [davisagli]

- Fixed new portlet template footer so it will validate, fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8769 thanks to bandigarf
  [calvinhp]

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8426.
  [malthe]

  [davisagli]

  [dunlapm]


1.1.5 (2008-08-18)

------------------

- Fixed i18n markup.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7068#comment:4
  [naro]

- The portletNavigationTree class was used for both the dl and the top
  ul. This makes things inconsistent since other levels in the tree
  used a navTree class for the ul, and uses the same class for two
  semantically very different items. Fixed by using navTree for the top
  ul as well.
  [wichert]


1.1.0 (2008-04-20)
------------------

- Added test for #7942. The fix is in plone.app.layout.
  [optilude]

- Fixed #8025 so that the named feeds now work to. Changed the package to
  use a different field.
  [mrtopf]

- ViewPageTemplate is meant to be used as a class variable and only
  works as instance variable by accident in current Zope. This fixes
  errors in Philipp and Hanno's aq refactor branch of Zope2.
  [wichert]

- Add a test to demonstrate #6100 and #7860. This is fixed in
  plone.portlets already.
  [optilude]

- Use the new GenericSetup.components blacklist feature when available.
  This gives our exportimport code full control over all components
  providing either IPortletType, IPortletManager or

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7149.
  [hannosch]

  [wichert]

- Added tests for the (not yet implemented) i18n markup support in
  portlets.xml.
  [hannosch]

  [hannosch]

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7388.
  [optilude]

  "remove" attribute.
  [fschulze]

- PLIP203: Add the ability to export and import portlet assignments and
  blacklisting.
  [optilude]

- PLIPs 205 and 218: Allow registering portlet types to multiple portlet
  manager interfaces, require portlet types to be explicitly registered
  for portlet manager interfaces, enable modifying registrations through
  GenericSetup, and restrict most default Plone portlet types to left/
  right/dashboard columns.
  [sirgarr]

- PLIP207: Allow custom portlet managers, i.e., allow specifying an
  alternative portlet manager class through GenericSetup.
  [sirgarr]


1.0.7 (UNRELEASED)
------------------

- Allow non-ASCII object paths while calculating cache key for
  portlets.  This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7086
  [nouri]

- Make the language portlet handle languages without a native name
  correctly.
  [wichert]

- Do not link to news_listing from the news portlet: that template has
  been removed from Plone. This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7872
  [wichert]


1.0.6
-----

- Sort the languages in the language portlet using their native name.
  [wichert]

- Fixed None value in query_string in calendar portlet. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7331.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed logic error in getRootPath in the last change.
  [hannosch]

- Only show the language portlet if more than one language is available.
  This brings it in sync with the language selection viewlet.
  [wichert]

  NuPlone which relies on the language selector portlet.
  [wichert]

- Fixed undefined variable name introduced in the last change.
  [hannosch]

- Correct getRootPath to not add a trailing / to paths if there
  are no context subelements. This was breaking webcouturier.dropdownmenu
  in situations where one of the sections was a navigation root.
  [wichert]


1.0.5
-----

- Made absolute_url() work properly on the custom adding views. This is
  necessary for the <base /> URL to be set correctly.

- Handle RSS feed entries which do not have an update timestamp correctly.
  This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7515
  [wichert]

- Provide proper 'id' implementations for assignment mappings and
  assignments. This makes absolute_url() work properly.
  [optilude]


1.0.2
-----

- Always try to refresh the RSS feed when rendering it instead of waiting
  for KSS to do trigger an updated. This is needed for the very common
  situation where most users are anonymous and the the feeds would expire
  (or never be loaded) and never (re)loaded.
  [wichert]

- Add a language selection portlet.
  [wichert]

- Fixed i18n markup bug in manage-content-type.pt.
  [hannosch]

  KSS. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7052.
  [hannosch]

- Make render_cachekey include the manager and assignment names, otherwise
  portlets that happen to have the same brains in their _data have the same
  cachekey.
  [ldr]


1.0.1
-----

- Remove use of login javascript methods.
  [ree]

- Change event portlet to use getIcon. This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5075.

---

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6908.
  [wichert]

- Verified translation of month names on the calendar portlet. Found a bit
  of missing i18n markup in the process. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6880.
  [hannosch]

- Wrapped cached render results with a xhtml_compress method taken from
  plone.memoize. This allows you to plug in whitespace removal libraries.
  [hannosch]

- Refactored calendar portlet and moved all calculations to the update
  method instead of doing it in its init.
  [hannosch]

- Use relative links on the calendar portlet for the previous and next
  links, so the portlet can be cached independent of the context.
  [hannosch]

- Cleaned up some templates, added missing i18n markup. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6721.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed erroneous wording in add screen for classicportlet.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6703

  uses of the DateTime module.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed tests to deal with the new default start_level of the navigation
  portlet.
  [hannosch]

- Made the workflow state to show configurable for the news and events
  portlets. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/1395.
  [hannosch]

- Changed the default navigation tree configuration to start at level 1,
  thus there is no longer an overlap with the global navigation section at
  the top. If you want the old behavior back, configure the portlet to
  start at level 0.
  [limi]

- Updated migration code to handle more converted portlets.
  [hannosch]

- Do now show the login portlet if there is no login/password PAS
  extractor configured.
  [wichert]

- Changed 'More news...' to 'More...' on RSS portlet as RSS feeds are not
  always news related. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6228.
  [sparcd]

- Added <thead> tags to calendar portlet because the <tbody> tags were
  causing it to fail W3C validation.

- Duplicate classes in login.pt were causing this to fail W3C HTML checks.
  Have merged the classes as this has a style="display:none" on it anyway.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6241.

- Make URLs more ploneish, by removing .html at the end. .html really
  should be reserved for when people create content that way, e.g. if
  uploading from WebDAV. :)
