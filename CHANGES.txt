Changelog
=========

1.0b1 - 2009-12-27
------------------

- Fixed package dependency declarations and use getSite from zope.site.
  [hannosch]

1.0a3 - 2009-12-16
------------------

- Make the password field optional for the admin when instead an email
  can be sent.
  [maurits]

- On the anonymous registration form, do not offer to send an email
  with a link to reset your password if the password fields are right
  there on the form already; we were never actually sending emails
  with the plain password itself anyway.
  [maurits]

- Allow admins to register a user at all times, also without valid
  mailhost settings.  This means that in a fresh Plone site you can
  create user accounts immediately without having to edit any
  settings.
  [maurits]

- Use the proper SimpleVocabulary/SimpleTerm API instead of encouraging bad
  practice. This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6480.
  [hannosch]

1.0a2 - 2009-12-01
------------------

- Display a message and prevent the user from registering if there is no
  defined mailhost and users are not allowed to select their own passwords.
  [esteele]

- "User/Groups Settings" configlet view is polished visually to follow rest of 
  configlets in "Users and Groups" control panel. Ref. #9825
  [spliter]

- For "User/Groups Settings" configlet highlighted "Member registration" tab 
  instead of the wrong "Settings"
  [spliter]

- @@new-user form will now always show the password fields, regardless of the
  site settings. 
  [esteele]

- Change registration form name @@join_form to @@register. Change class names
  accordingly. Added an "@@new-user" form to be used from the control panel.
  "Add to group" functionality now lives there. We can now get rid of the 
  horrid came_from flags that we've been passing around.
  [esteele]

- Internationalized title_join_form_fields and description_join_form_fields.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/attachment/ticket/9810

1.0a1 - 2009-11-18
------------------

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9773
  [vincentfretin]

- Renamed label_groups to label_add_to_groups in joinform.py
  [vincentfretin]

- Restore the came_from_prefs check to make the join form redirect to the
  Users and Groups configlet if that's where the user started from.
  [davisagli]
