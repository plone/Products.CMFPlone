Avoid a plone.protect warning on `index_html` documents in portal root.

`index_html` are often used to create default pages in containers. On the
portal root this was prevented by a problem in a name collision checker in
plone.base, fixed in https://github.com/plone/plone.base/pull/107 and a
plone.protect warning issued by a write-on-read by setting the
`__replaceable__` attribute on the `index_html` object.
